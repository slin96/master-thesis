# ModelDB

- a bit like git but specialized in ML data + a web-based interface 
- demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JVehm5Ohg4&feature=youtu.be)
- problem no implementation and no insights!

## Interesting 
- implemented dlv, a command-line versioning system similar to git but for data
- the use a *novel parameter storage (PAS) that archives model versions using deltas in a multi-resolution fashion*
- the use ProvDB (built on Neo4j) to store: *provenance metadata and other information* 
(don't they what other information)
