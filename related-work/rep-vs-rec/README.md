# Replicate vs Reproduce

- our main source to define the terms *replicate* vs *reproduce* is the paper
  [Terminologies for Reproducible Research](./Terminologies-for-Reproducible-Research.pdf)
- this paper defines three categories, and also gives references to publications and groups them by category
    - A: make no distinction between the words **reproduce** and **replicate**
    - **B1**:
        - **reproduce**: same data+same methods=same results
        - **replicate**: new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings
    - B2: swaps the terms

- We go with the definitions from ACM which is *B1*
    - in the past this used to be different, it was *B2*, see below

## Comment on ACM definitions

- according to the [Terminologies for Reproducible Research](./Terminologies-for-Reproducible-Research.pdf)
  paper the ACM falls in the category *B2*
- the author stated that the group *B2* is a minority. According to Table 2 only the disciplines of microbiology/
  immunology (FASEB) and computer science (ACM) use the terms according to category **B2**
- due to this **ACM changed their terms** which can be seen in their latest document
  on [Artifact Review and Badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)
  to use the more common definitions of category *B1*
