# Snapshot Training Times
- throughout the experiment that are based on the evaluation flow we used models, pretrained on a GPU machine
- the code to produce the models can be found [here](../train-models)
- while performing the training to produce these models, we alo produce logs to get an idea how long the training takes
- we analyze these logs in [this](training-times.ipynb) jupyter notebook
