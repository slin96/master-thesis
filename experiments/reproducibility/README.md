# Reproducibility Experiments

In this directory we provide two types of experiments that show 

- **the reproducibility of our selected models in a CPU and GPU environment**
    - ([link to experiment](./probing))
    
- **that the provenance approach of mmlib is capable of saving models without loss of precision**
    - ([link to experiment](./mmlib))
