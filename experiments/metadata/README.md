# Metadata
- some analysis of metadata for models we use or other models that are commonly used
  
- using `torchsummary` to find out general information and primarily the number of parameters for a given model
    - `model_parameters.ipynb`
    
- analysing the size of the used models and comparing to the image sizes in the used datasets
    - `imagenet_model_vs_data.ipynb`
    
- analysing the size of a model implementing the Bahdanau attention and some datasets we could use to train it
    - `bahdanau_vs_data.ipynb`
