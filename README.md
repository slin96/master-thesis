### MISTIQUE: A System to Store and Query Model Intermediates for Model Diagnosis
- MISTIQUE: **M**odel **I**ntermediate **ST**ore and **QU**ery **E**ngine
- not really *Model Management*, but *Model Intermediate Management*
- Goal: Efficiently capture, store and query **model intermediates** for diagnosis
- **interesting**: techniques to reduce storage footprint, cost models
- [notes](./mistique/README.md)

### Automatically Tracking Metadata and Provenance of Machine Learning Experiments
- **mainly interesting: presented [schema](https://github.com/awslabs/ml-experiments-schema)** 
- lightweight system to extract, store and manage metadata and prove- nance information of common artifacts in machine
 learning (ML) experiments
- tracking: datasets, models, predictions, evaluations and training runs
- [notes](./tracking-meta/README.md)

### On Challenges in Machine Learning Model Management
- **Model Management**: training, maintenance, deployment, monitoring, organization and documentation of machine 
learning (ML) models
- discuss a selection of ML use cases
- **overview over conceptual, engineering, and data-processing related challenges**
- point out future research directions
